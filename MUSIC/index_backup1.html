       <h3>The Special Challenge of Music</h3>
	<p tabindex="0">Music has a special challenge not found in most other fields.  One must be a consumer and producer simulatneously.  In other words, a musician must be a consumer ("reading" notes) as well as a producer ("play music") at the same time.  It's also true that reading sophisticated scores requires an ability to "read" the music holistically.</p>

<p tabindex="0">For accreditation purposes, there is a requirement to be able to read and write music.  Because of technology, writing music is largely accessible to those with disabilities, because of music-writing technology that has become widely accepted in the field; in particular, Sibelius, and Finale.  Reading music is more problematic.  Neither Braille nor LaTeX, two commonly promoted solutions, do not offer the same opportunity to perceive music notation holistically, which is necessary for discipline-specific discussions of music.  The function of a chord, how measures are outlined, the position of the staff and where it rests all must be processed holistically.  Linear processes such as those used in Braille and LaTeX do not allow for this.  Consequently, should a blind student with to pursue advanced music, tactical means will be used, such as raised paper or three-dimensional representations of the music.</p>

      <h4>A note on Sibelius</h4>
      <p tabindex="0">Any time a technology that is used by those without disabilities may also be used by those with disabilities, learning becomes much more inclusive.  Classmates are able to sit side-by-side and learn. Sibleus is one such technology.  In the history of its development, committed developers donated time to help make the software more accessible.  Here's some excerpts:</p>

	<p tabindex="0" class="quoted">It has taken me decades to be able to say that Iâ€™m a composer. When I was young, I used to say that I was a pianist, then a jazz pianist, then a songwriter. I only settled on considering myself a composer a few short years ago. The thing that made it possible for me to make that conscious professional choice was the development of music notation software that could be used by a composer with a serious visual disability. That software was Sibelius.</p>
	<p tabindex='0" class="quoted">The path to developing Sibelius as a resource for me and the blind and visually impaired community has been a work in progress since Sibelius made its appearance in the music industry. However, over the years, improvements to the software have been promising, especially recently. With the newest release of Sibelius, version 7.5.1, it better supports blind and visually impaired musicians with the ability to use screen readers like NonVisual Desktop Access (NVDA) on Windows.</p>
	     <p tabindex="0" class="quoted">For those of you who are not familiar with the concept of a screen reader, its purpose is to read the contents of the screen to a blind or visually impaired user. There are several packages commercially available. The best known of these is called JAWS (Jobb Access With Speech).</p>
