         <h3>Why permit alternate versions?</h3>
	  <p tabindex="0" class="quoted">Why does WCAG permit conforming alternate versions of Web pages to be included in conformance claims? That is, why include pages that do not satisfy the Success Criteria for a conformance level in the scope of conformance or a claim?</p>
	   <p tabindex="0" class="quotedsource"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/conformance.html#uc-support-level-head">as accessed 3 February 2020</a></p>

     <h4>WCAG's response</h4>
	   <p tabindex="0" class="quoted">Sometimes, pages use technologies that are not yet accessibility supported. When a new technology emerges, assistive technology support may lag behind, or may only be available to some target audiences. So authors may not be able to rely on the new technology for all users. However, there may be other benefits to using the new technology, e.g., better performance, a wider range of modalities available, etc. The alternate version requirement allows authors to include such Web pages in their Web site by providing an accessible alternative page in technologies that are accessibility supported. Users for whom the new technology is adequately supported get the benefits of the new version. Authors who look ahead to future accessibility support can satisfy the Success Criteria now with the alternate version page, and also work with the other page to build in future access when assistive technology (AT) support is available.</p>
	   <p tabindex="0" class="quoted">For a variety of reasons, it may not be possible to modify some content on a Web page. For instance,<br/>

It may be critical to include an exact visual copy of a document for legal or historical reasons<br/>

The Web page may be included in a site but the site owner may not have the legal rights to modify the content on the original page<br/>

The company may not legally be able to remove, or alter in any way, something that was previously posted.<br />

An author may not have permission to alter a document from another department, agency, or company</p>	 
	   <p tabindex="0" class="quoted">Sometimes, the best experience for users with certain types of disabilities is provided by tailoring a Web page specifically to accommodate that disability. In such a situation, it may not be possible or practical to make the Web page accommodate all disabilities by satisfying all of the Success Criteria. The alternate versions requirement permits such specialized pages to be included within a conformance claim as long as there is a fully conformant 'alternate version' page.</p>	 
	   <p tabindex="0" class="quoted">Many sites which are committed to accessibility have large quantities of legacy documents. While the information has been made available in accessible formats, there would be significant institutional resistance and procedural obstacles to removing these files en mass. Some organizations, especially governmental bodies, give precedence to traditional print-oriented processes. Even as these organizations have adapted to Internet publishing and embraced the need for accessible formats, they still retain a paper mindset and often insist on formats designed for hard copy as the "primary" version (even for documents that are only ever "published" electronically). Although the Working Group feels these approaches should be deprecated it does not feel they can be forbidden so long as accessible versions are readily available.</p>

     <h4>Understanding Conforming Alternate Versions</h4>
       <p tabindex="0" class="quoted">Conformance requirement #1 allows non-conforming pages to be included within the scope of conformance as long as they have a "conforming alternate version". The conforming alternative version is defined as:</p>
	<p tabindex="0" class="quoted">conforming alternate version</p>
	  <ul>
	   <li class="quoted">1. conforms at the designated level, and</li>
	   <li class="quoted">2. provides all of the same information and functionality in the same human language, and</li>
	   <li class="quoted">3. is as up to date as the non-conforming content, and</li>
	     <li class="quoted">4. for which at least one of the following is true:</li>
		  <ul>
		   <li class="quoted">a. the conforming version can be reached from the non-conforming page via an accessibility-supported mechanism, or</li>
			   <li class="quoted">b. the non-conforming version can only be reached from the conforming version, or</li>
			   <li class="quoted">c. the non-conforming version can only be reached from a conforming page that also provides a mechanism to reach the conforming version</li>

	   <h4>Third Party Problems</h4>
   <p tabindex="0" class="quoted">Sometimes, Web pages are created that will later have additional content added to them. For example, an email program, a blog, an article that allows users to add comments, or applications supporting user-contributed content. Another example would be a page, such as a portal or news site, composed of content aggregated from multiple contributors, or sites that automatically insert content from other sources over time, such as when advertisements are inserted dynamically.</p>
