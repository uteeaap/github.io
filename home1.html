        <p tabindex="0">Programmatically speaking, how is WCAG 2.0 evaluated with our automated tool?</p>
	 <p tabindex="0">Our automated checker uses research, as outlined in the paper:
<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/RD/2011/metrics/paper11/">TOWARDS A SCORE FUNCTION FOR WCAG 2.0 BENCHMARKING</a> 5 December 2011</a> in order to evaluate accessibility.</p>

People need to open their minds to the fact that no formal AT exists for low vision that produces accessible enlargement. Screen Magnifiers don't produce accessible displays. Screen readers are good as far as they go, but they are do not provide a self paced medium for low vision as they do for users who are blind, namely refreshable braille.</p>

   <p tabindex="0">No.</p>
   <p tabindex="0" class="quoted bold">Domino’s Pizza and the Supreme Court</p>
   <p tabindex="0" class="quoted">On January 15, 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a dismissal of the website accessibility lawsuit Robles v. Domino’s Pizza. The lawsuit, filed in 2016 by Guillermo Robles, had been previously dismissed by a district court on the grounds that a) it violated the primary jurisdiction doctrine and b) the lack of legal technical standards for public accommodation breached due process.</p>	
   <p tabindex="0" class="quoted">However, the panel of appellate judges ruled that the due process claim was flimsy and lack of specific guidelines did not let Domino’s off the hook. They concluded that a lower level California district court should proceed with the litigation and start the discovery process to determine whether Domino’s Pizza’s digital assets comply with the ADA regulations.</p>

   <h4>So what do we do?</h4>
   <p tabindex="0">We make an honest effort. We employ known tools that evaluate accessibility and test them with real-world tests.  We create a plan for alternative means and ensure that the subject matters experts are involved.  The plan must be developed from the bottom up, with the opinions of the experts involved.</p>
   <p>Here's some options under Section 504 as explained by <a href="https://brailleworks.com">BrailleWorks</a></p>

   <p tabindex="0">You may want to read more from BrailleWorks on the section titled, <a href="https://brailleworks.com/section-504-guide/">How does Section 504 apply to education?</a>.  An excerpt follows.</p>
   <p tabindex="0" class="quoted">Section 504 for education is broken up into two areas: Elementary & Secondary as one area, and Post–secondary (college, university, technical training) as the other.</p>
	<h4>Here's a bit more on Section 504</h4>
	   <p tabindex="0" class="quoted">Yes. Section 504 and Title II protect elementary, secondary, and postsecondary students from discrimination. Nevertheless, several of the requirements that apply through high school are different from the requirements that apply beyond high school. For instance, Section 504 requires a school district to provide a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to each child with a disability in the district’s jurisdiction. Whatever the disability, a school district must identify an individual’s educational needs and provide any regular or special education and related aids and services necessary to meet those needs as well as it is meeting the needs of students without disabilities.</p>
	   <p tabindex="0" class="quoted">Unlike your high school, however, your postsecondary school is not required to provide FAPE. Rather, <span style="font-weight:bold">your postsecondary school is required to provide appropriate academic adjustments as necessary to ensure that it does not discriminate on the basis of disability.</span> In addition, if your postsecondary school provides housing to nondisabled students, it must provide comparable, convenient, and accessible housing to students with disabilities at the same cost.</p>
	   <p tabindex="0" class="quotedsource"><a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/transition.html">OCR Students with Disabilities Preparing for Postsecondary Education:</a></p>
	   <p tabindex="0" >Note the phrase: <span style="font-weight:bold">your postsecondary school is required to provide appropriate academic adjustments as necessary to ensure that it does not discriminate on the basis of disability.</span>  An Equally Effective Access Plan provides that guidance concerning appropriate academic adjustments.</p>
     <h4>More than you want to know: What it means to be a web page</h4>
	<p tabindex="0"><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1736">Functional Recommendations for Internet Resource Locators</a></p>
	<p tabindex="0">Also see: <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1867.txt">Form-based File Upload in HTML</a></p>
	<h4>Definitions are under discussion</h4>
	<p tabindex="0" class="quoted">More and more we are seeing situations like #8 where the 3rd party application using the source file's information is itself a web-based application, so the information that is rendered from the source file would be presented as content within that web app, so would be covered. But if the file is downloaded and then used by the stand-alone application, I think that 8 is out of scope for WCAG.</p>
