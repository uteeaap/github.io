   <h4>Do you know of statistical analysis software that is accessible for the blind?</h4>
    <p tabindex="0" class="quoted">Standard statistical software packages such as SPSS are not accessible for blind individuals that utilize screen readers.  Do any of the blind researchers out there have any suggestions for accessible software for statistical analysis? I am about to supervise a blind student who is trying to find tools to overcome this challenge.</p>
    <p tabindex="0" class="quotedsource"><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/post/Do_you_know_of_statistical_analysis_software_that_is_accessible_for_the_blind">https://www.researchgate.net/post/Do_you_know_of_statistical_analysis_software_that_is_accessible_for_the_blind</a> | asked in 2014</p>
	  <p tabindex="0" class="quoted">I have not used qualitative software in 5 years, but in 2013, NVivo did NOT work with JAWS or any other screenreader I tried,. I would be extremely surprised if this has changed. I used Atlas with JAWS and could use most of its features. I would try Atlas first; you can probably get a trial version. If this research you are doing on your own and your sample is relatively small, then you may not want to use specialized software. Instead, you may want to work out your own coding strategy using MS Word or similar program. The Institute for Community Inclusion at the Univercity of Massachusetts Boston used to use Atlas because of its accessibility with JAWS, and you may want to check with the ICI to see if they are still using Atlas or if they have found something else. There are other qualitative software packages, but I have no experience with them. You may need to download trials with someone who knows that software and experiment with your screenreader. Good luck! | response 7th Jul 2018</p>
	  <p tabindex="0" class="quotedsource">am certain this answer is far past the time when you needed it, but I use SPSS and STATA with JAWS and have used SAS with JAWS in the past. The student needs to be a Windows user; these do not work on Mac with voiceOver. The main issue one faces is with upgrades, there was a period of three years when SPSS was not accessible just after IBM acquired it. However, starting with version 20 it worked again. I had been advised to start using R during this time that I call the SPSS blackout, but no one I was trained by nor any of my research partners used R, so doing so meant I was completely on my own. I have not used R, but I do recognize that I will likely do so in the future (post tenure). I think the major issue for an instructor is to find a product you can use with all students, so if you use R, then use R for everyone. With SPSS, SAS, or STATA the student with the visual impairment needs to learn the syntax or programming language and the means by which output can be read for whatever program one is using. If it is SPSS the output needs to be exported to a Word document, which can be set up. With STATA a log file must be used in its text version, and this was the case several years ago when I used SAS as well. People with visual impairments, even those with advanced degrees have difficulties finding and maintaining full-time employment in the mainstream of Universities and industry, and I think it is important to make sure that products that are used by researchers out there can also be used for training students with visual impairments and professionals alike. While I am glad to know R is working for some to the extent there is a blind users group, other products are more widely used. Hence, the scientific and assistive technology communities need to come together. Either we need more R-trained users out there adopting it for use in their research or we need more attention given by the producers of statistical software to make it possible for blind users and those teaching or working with them to gather the necessary information on how to. And while I am on the subject, I long for advanced statistical materials to be accessible so I can continue to increase my analysis skills. However, these materials are extremely difficult to obtain and have become more difficult to get now that I am not a student. | response 5 May 2018</p>
