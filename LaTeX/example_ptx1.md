                <p><alert>MATH 219 Calculus I</alert> (Gen. Ed. Domain II-A)</p>
				<p> A study of functions, limits, continuity, the derivative, rules of differentiation of algebraic, trigonometric, exponential and logarithmic functions, applications of differentiation, definite and indefinite integrals, and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.</p>
                <p><em>Prerequisite:</em> Completion of MATH 180 Precalculus with a minimum grade of C (2.00) or better, or a satisfactory score on the mathematics placement examination.</p>
                <p><alert>Course Goal:</alert> To exploit the algebraic and trigonometric methods treated in prerequisite courses in an effort to lay the foundation of the Calculus sequence, exploring limits and continuity, mastering techniques of differentiation, and developing the definition of the definite integral, culminating in the discovery and understanding of Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.</p>

            <title>Quizzes and Exams</title>
                <p> Quizzes and exams will be largely based on the assigned homework.  Calculators will not be allowed for quizzes or exams, and credit will not be awarded for any answer that does not include sufficient work.  The instructor reserves the right to make an exam in-class or take-home.  Makeup quizzes or late exams will not be permitted under any circumstances.  Only in rare cases will a student be permitted to take an exam early.  For more information regarding allowable excuses for taking an exam early, see the instructor.</p>

            <section xml:id="attendance_and_participation">
            <title>Attendance</title>
                <p> Attendance will not be taken.  Students who have been observed by the instructor as either frequently absent or late to class or non-participatory may be subject to point deductions from their overall course score.  Students are responsible for obtaining lecture notes from their classmates for any classes missed.  At any point during the semester, students may be asked to provide proper documentation to the Office of Student Affairs, justifying any absence from the University.</p>

            <section xml:id="homework">
            <title>Homework</title>
                <p> Homework will be assigned from each section for practice.  These assignments represent a minimum number of problems needed for basic understanding of key concepts, and students are expected to attempt as many problems from each covered section of the text as time permits, for a more complete understanding of the course content.  This should be done prior to any quizzes and exams.  Homework sets will only be assigned and collected in class for grading purposes when the instructor deems it necessary.  Under no circumstances will late homework assignments or electronic submissions of any kind be accepted.  Students are strongly encouraged to discuss homework problems with their classmates, as well as the instructor, either during office hours or at the start of class.</p>
				<p> Additionally, online homework assignments will be posted periodically for additional practice through the platform chosen by the instructor.  More information regarding these assignments will be provided at a later date.</p>

            <section xml:id="student_expectations_and_academic_honesty">
            <title>Student Expectations and Academic Honesty</title>
                <p><alert>Expectations of the Student:</alert> Students should devote a minimum of 2-3 hours of study time to the course for every fifty minutes of in-class time (8-12 hours per week).  It is especially recommended for a two-day per week course that students devote at least 1 hour of study time to the course each weeknight.  Additionally, students are expected to be actively reading the course text and attempting homework problems while each section is being covered (not after).  Lastly, any student with non-academic obligations (e.g. part-time employment) is strongly encouraged to pay close attention to their course standing throughout the semester, so as to not fall behind in their studies.</p>
                <p>At times, this course will rely on concepts introduced in College Algebra and Precalculus.  It is essential that students resolve any prerequisite course material concerns as soon as they arise.  Given size of the class and the nature of the course content, students with any concerns are encouraged to seek help from the instructor early on in the semester.</p>
                <p><alert>Academic Honesty:</alert> All students should familiarize themselves with the University's policy regarding academic honesty, which can be found in the Undergraduate Catalog.  Listed below are the most common infractions of the University's policy for a mathematics course.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Plagiarism: claiming as one’s own work the published or unpublished literal or paraphrased work of another. It should be recognized that plagiarism is not only academically dishonest but also illegal.</li>
                    <li>Cheating on exams, tests, quizzes, assignments, and papers, including the giving or acceptance of these materials and other sources of information without the permission of the instructor(s).</li>
                    <li>Unauthorized collaboration with other individuals in the preparation of course assignments.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><alert>Violations of this policy in any way will not be tolerated.</alert></p>

            <section xml:id="additional_information">
            <title>Additional Information</title>
                <p><alert>Email Policy:</alert> It is the policy of the University to use framingham.edu email addresses for all official email correspondence between faculty, staff, and students.

All important course documents will be posted on the designated Blackboard site.</p>
                <p><alert>Academic Support Services:</alert> Tutoring is available for most 100 and 200-level courses through the Department of Mathematics, as well as the Center for Academic Support and Achievement (CASA).  Additionally, Supplemental Instruction may be available for certain sections of 100 and 200-level courses.  Students are encouraged to work in groups on any assignments, especially when no campus support is available.  All students who are struggling with the material are strongly encouraged to utilize the instructor's office hours.</p>
