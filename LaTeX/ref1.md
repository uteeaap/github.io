```Deaf and hard of hearing people are often assumed to not face difficulties when reading
or navigating webpages. That assumption is far from reality, and excludes many
individuals. Words commonly used in astrophysics often lack direct equivalents in sign
language and so must be painstakingly spelled out letter by letter. Ideally every word
used in a journal article should have a translation to sign language. The Office of
Astronomy for Development (OAD) and the Office of Astronomy for Outreach (OAO) are
coordinating efforts to address the lack of sign language for astrophysical words at the
professional level, and as needed to develop international signs. ```

```We mentioned previously that a list of steps for developers to follow is not the
solution, even though our suggestions below may look like a list. Lists limit creativity,
limit possible new solutions, and may be unintentionally taken as absolute, thereby
leaving out the very important phase of continuous focus groups and usability testing.```
```Multimodal Access
● Provide multiple modes of access to the information contained in journal
articles. Possibilities include podcasts, presentation slides, and videos to
complement research articles. Options should be made available for embedding
varied media formats (audio, video).
● The format of articles should allow Braille embossing. ```
