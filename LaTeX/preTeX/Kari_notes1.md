```Some others talked about PreTeXt: https://pretextbook.org/```

```A description of how one speaker uses PreTeXt is here: http://jointmathematicsmeetings.org/amsmtgs/2245_abstracts/1154-c5-2181.pdf```

```This is an example of a textbook where PreTeXt and MathJax were used: http://math.oscarlevin.com/math322/index.html```

```More textbook information is here: https://github.com/oscarlevin/discrete-book/```

```I have attached a syllabus template in PreTeXt from one of the session organizers to this email.  I was able to open it in Notepad.```
